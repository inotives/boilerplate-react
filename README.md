## Boilerplate React
This is a very basic react application development boilerplate for beginner that start to learn react.
It come with webpack bundling as well as material ui included. i had included an easy example of using react to create an simple dashboard which will fetch real time price feed from one of the bitcoin exchange.

### How to run

1. Clone this repo
2. Once cloned, CD into the root directory and run `npm run setup`. this will run npm install and bower install to install all the dependencies
3. Once all is installed, run `npm run build` to compile the src code to dist folder.
4. Now you can serve the compiled content by running `npm run serve`.
5. For development, open new tap on your terminal and run `npm run dev` which will run watcher for continuous compiling when there are changes. the previous npm serve will auto serve to browser when it detect there are changes in the dist folder.
